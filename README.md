# data-update-github

A remote data change triggers the issue of a pull request to a specified Github repository.

## Install

Run `npm ci` to install all dependencies.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` or `grunt lint` to lint.

## Scripts

### Auto update ODC data files

* Script: scripts/fetchODCDataFiles.js

* Goal: Check if a new version of the open dataset documenting COVID-19 assessment centre locations has been published
on the [Ontario Data Catalogue API](https://data.ontario.ca/api/3/action/package_show?id=covid-19-assessment-centre-locations).
If the dataset has been updated, this script downloads the file, updates the corresponding latest.json, and issues a
pull request against the [COVID assessment centres data repository](https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/).

* Prerequisites: Tasks below need to complete before running the script:
  * Define an environment variable `GITHUB_ACCOUNT_URL`: This variable defines the Github repository URL with an
embedded authenticated Github account that pull requests will be issued on behalf. Refer to [the Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
about how to create a Github personal access token and use it for authenticating HTTPS Git operations.
An example: `https://{username}:{personal-access-token}@github.com/wecountproject/covid-assessment-centres.git`
  * Visit [the config file](./scripts/fetchODCConfig.json5) to set proper config values. Purpose of these values are
explained in the config file.

* How to run:
`node scripts/fetchODCDataFiles.js`
